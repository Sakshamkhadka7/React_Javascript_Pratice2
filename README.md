# React + Vite

:hourglass: **Journey of Learning Reactjs from Scratch**  :hourglass:

:pencil2: This project has some bug/error because this Project I learned from youtube so I couldnot make bug free so I will fixed this error when I will Learn all about react js  

This is a simple react based social media app that demonstrates how react-router-dom helps to hyperlink from one page to another without reloading whole page
Using Form ,redirect,useNavigate hook from react-router-dom package and fetching a dummy API to display default post in HomeScreen

When I was learning a React js I used a props frequently which I have to passed through every components even in those components where that props is not required 
so to reduce those demerits I learn a useContext props API which allows us to make one store using createContext where all the businnes logic is stored and then we can use those method or logic from any components which reduce unneccessary passing props form one components to another

In first I have used different hook to develop this app useRef in createPost.jsx to get the input that user has entered .
learned how to use useState logically to display postList or createPost
Gain valuable knowledge about useReducer hook where how dispatch initaited action and passed to the method 
In learning process then I went to learn about useEffect hooks whch is used to make the Api call and handle 

I have also explore a useCallback hooks which is used to re-render when the dependency make changes which helps to save memory
